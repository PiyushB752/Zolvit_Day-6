# Week-1-Summary

 ### Day 1 - Introduction to Testing in Node.js
 On day 1, I learnt about what is testing and its importance in development of big softwares. Also I learnt about what is mocha and chai packages and how these packages are being used for testing major functionalities of software.

 I applied the concepts of testing with Mocha and Chai by using 3 simple functions and testing those functions under test file. Under the test file, there are some test cases and some sample inputs for that function to be tested. Next we run the test and we see the results of those test cases. In this way, we can identify which functionality is not working as per our expectations.

### Day 2 - Unit Testing with Mocha and Chai
On day 2, I learnt about what is are the different types of testing and their different usages in terms of testing. Also i learnt about how to apply unit testing for testing a single functionality in a software application.

I applied the concepts of unit testing with Mocha and Chai by using 4 simple functions and testing those functions under test file. Under the test file, there are 4 unit test cases for each function and some sample inputs for each function. Next we run the test and we the results of those unit test cases. In this way, we can identify which function is able to handle each and every type of input and give the expected results.

### Day 3 - Integration Testing with Supertest - 
On day 3, I learnt about how to test various https requests like the CRED operations such as GET, POST, PUT and DELETE. Also i have learnt how to use mocha, chai and supertest packages for testing an http request and getting the required result.

I applied the concepts of testing with Mocha, Chai and Supertest by using 2 simple request that is GET and POST request, and testing those functions under test file. Under the test file, there are some test cases for each request and some sample inputs for each request. Next we run the test and we the results of those unit test cases. In this way, we can identify which http function is able to handle each and every type of input and give the expected results.

### Day 4 - Testing with In-Memory MongoDB - 
On day 4, I learnt about how to create a sample database without creating a database in MongoDB but instead using In Memory MongoDb concept to try to store sample datas in a temporary database created in the application.  

I applied the concepts of In-Memory MongoDB by using Mocha, Chai and Mongodb memory server packages and testing those some http requests under test file. Under the test file, there are some test cases for each request to check the running status. Next we run the test and we the results of those unit test cases. In this way, we can identify which http function is able to handle each and every type of input and give the expected results. In this way, we can identify which http function is able to handle each and every type of input and check how the sample database is running and giving the required output.

### Day 5 - Test Coverage and Reporting - 
On day 5, I learnt about what is test coverage and how much it is an important element while testing various test cases. Also I have learnt how to get the coverage of all the test cases using c8 package. 

I applied the concepts of test coverage using c8 Package. I have took the Day 1 project and implemented the test coverage package into the project. Next we return the coverage terminal line and we the overall reports of the working test cases. In this way, we can identify which all test cases are working properly and also have a check over various functionalities.

### Day 6 - Assessment - 
On day 6, we had an assessment based on this week's learning.

That's the end of week 1.
